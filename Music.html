   <h2>Final Fantasy VI Music analysis </h2>
 <p>Final Fantasy 6 has the greatest music of any video game every song works perfectly witheachother<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mKyg_pdrg6J7_wJzmBWwPk7WPFI03hED0">if youd like to listen to the music click 
   here to be brang to the whole album</a></p>
  <p>My favourie song in the game is dancing mad the final bosses song it brings everything you want for a final bossfight hype energy and despair it shows that this is now or never and i think it works so well<br>
  id also be doing a disjustes to the game is i didnt mention the art that is the opening. The opening proves that Final Fantasy 6 is a work of art standing the test of time.</p>

  <p>To end of what just is the tip of the iceberg of Final Fantsy 6s music i have to talk about the opera. Having an entire opera in your game is so legandary and cant be understated. The influence that scene has had on
    media to this day stil makes it noteworthy</p>
