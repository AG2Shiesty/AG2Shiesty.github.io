   <h2>Final Fantasy VI Music analysis </h2>
 <p>Final Fantasy 6 has the greatest music of any video game every song works perfectly witheachother<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mKyg_pdrg6J7_wJzmBWwPk7WPFI03hED0">if youd like to listen to the music click

  <p>My favourie song in the game is dancing mad the final bosses song it brings everything you want for a final bossfight hype energy and despair it shows that this is now or never and i think it works so well</p>
