   <h2>Final Fantasy VI battle mechanics </h2>
 <p>Final Fantasy 6 is a rurn based rpg similar to dragon quest or shin megami tensei<br> Final Fantsay 6 may have the best version of this rpg style though.</p>
  <ol><em>heres what makes Final Fantasy 6 so special mechanics wise</em></ol>
  <li>Final Fantasy 6 has 14 permanent party members all with unique skills</li>
   <li>Magicite is a sytem that teaches your party members magic stats skills and can summon espers to battle it adds alot to the game and incopertates replay value</li>
  <li> unique secondary attack skill sets makes each character have a purpose and is not overshadoed by any other character</li>

  <p>The list really could go on by id like to dive into more specfic things<br> Like how some people dislike the battle mechanics in FF6 <strong>I think this statment is crazy
  </strong> due to all of the betiufly done abilites in the game every character plays so diffrently and it culanates in a beutiful dance of sorts in game.</p>
  <p>I'd be remissd to not talk about the final boss kefka this is where the mechanics truly shine it is done so well being the only final boss where you use all your party
    memebers in the epic of a final boss he controls all espers has multaple phases and is a true god. you have to give verything youve got to try and beat Kefka in 
    his god state and i could rave about this fight for hours but i think ill leave it here.</p>
