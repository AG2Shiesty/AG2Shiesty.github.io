  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Final_Fantasy_VI.jpg">
<p>Final Fantasy 6 is my favourte video game of all time and I truly belive it is a masterpeice. From its engaging storytelling, masterclass combat mechanics, and its leganadry music theres somthing for everyone.</p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDMWp1oLoA0">The intro to this game is one of the most iconic and legandary intros for anythng click on this line to view it</a>
<p>This will be the article that disscusses the story of Final Fantasy six so spoilers ahead.
The story of Final Fantasy 6 is one of many storys and becuase id be writing forever if i tried to explain the whole thing ill
  just go over the highlights. </p>
  <p>Starting off with opening as mentioned before the opening is one of the most iconic openings ever and for a good reason 
    this opening shows so much character and world building introducing us to one of our main characters.</p>

   <p>Next id like to talk about the opera scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe3pGU9jcag"> which you can watch here</a></p>
  <p>This scene is so famously iconic and for good reason it was ground breaking at the time having a full oprea scene in your video game was completly unherad
    of and having an iconic bossfight afterward with Ultros futher adds to this scenes longevity and iconicness.</p>
  <p>I couldnt talk about the story of Final Fantasy 6 without mentioning <strong> Kefka</strong></p>
     <p> Kefka is the main villain of FF6 and he is one to rememner being one of my favourite villains in fiction here is a small list of things hes done</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Commit war crimes</li>
         <li>Enslave an entire race of poeple</li>
         <li>Destroy the world</li>
         <li>Treason</li>
       </ul>
  <p>The list just gos on but those are just some memerable ones</p>
  <p>Final fantasy sixs story is truly to massive to go over so i just gave my highlights but theres so much more to go over so i made a little top five ranking of my favourte things in the story.</p>
